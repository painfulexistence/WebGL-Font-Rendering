# WebGL Font Rendering

An experiment with font rendering techniques. ([Olle Alvin (2020)](https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9024910&fileOId=9024911) did an awesome literature review for this topic.)

The current implementation is based on the signed distance field text rendering technique introduced by [Chirs Green (2007)](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf). I would also like to implement the multi-channel signed distance field text rendering method proposed by [Viktor ChlumskÃ½ (2015)](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen/files/3050967/thesis.pdf) later.

## [Live Demo](https://webgl-font-rendering.onrender.com)

- Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- Use mouse drag to pan around

  > **Note**<br>
  > Only supports displaying Extended ASCII characters for the moment

## To-Do

1. Move the font texture generation procedure into a worker thread
2. Replace tinySDF with [msdfgen-wasm](https://github.com/painfulexistence/msdfgen-wasm) to get better rendering result

## Building

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn preview --port 8080 # Check out http://localhost:8080
```

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```
